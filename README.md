## India's Population
![India's populations](india_pop.png)
<addr> This graph illustrates the total population in India since 1960 to 2019. Data for 2020 has not been collected at this point. However, India's population seems to have a steady increase (almost linear) over this time period. The graph indicates there might be a very slight decrease in population increase rate as the graph approaches 2020.
